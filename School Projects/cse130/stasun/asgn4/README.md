### 1. Intro

This program inmplements a thread safe queue and reader and writer locks for multithreaded operations.  

### 2. Building the Program

To build the program, enter the terminal and make sure you are in the directory that contains this program. Then, type `make` or `make all`. This will make all of the object (.o) files, `queue.o` and `rwlock.o`. If you would like to make each .o file individually, you can type `make queue.o` and `make rwlock.o` to make the respective .o file.

### 3. Cleaning

If you would like to clean the directory after building the program, go into the terminal in the directory with the program, and type in the command `make clean`. This will remove the executables `httpserver`, as well as all of the .o files created by the build process.
