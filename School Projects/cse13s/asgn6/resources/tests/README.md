# Tests for Trie and WordTable

How to:

- copy the tests directory into your repository at `<cruzid>/asgn6/tests`
- Install `check` with `sudo apt install check`
- `cd` into `tests`
- `make` to build and run the tests

Note: If you have errors in your other c files, tests will not build, they
depend on your Makefile. You could temporarily rename your other c files to
something like `ss.c.bak`Â to avoid it trying to compile your files.
